Title: Work with interval-based time-indexed data frames
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: c(
  person(given = "Ian", family = "Lyttle", email = "ian.lyttle@schneider-electric.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),

  )
Description: At some point, it will be nice to have a well-formulated grammar
  and DSL for dealing with time-indexed data frames. Until then, this package
  is yet another attempt to get that grammar to reveal itself through a 
  half-baked implementation that can be used to solve a few problems.
